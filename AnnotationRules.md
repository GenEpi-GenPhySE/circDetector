### The annotation classes

 
   [Class-1]   
   The class-1 includes circRNAs with Start-circRNAs is identified as exonic boundary
   
   [Class-2]   
   The class-1 includes circRNAs with End-circRNAs is identified as exonic boundary
   
   [class-12]     
   Exonic circRNA is generated by the circularization of one or several exons through a back splicing process: the end of an exon is joined to the beginning of an upstream exon. In the circular junction sequenced an exonic downstream donor 3’ splice site is covalently joined to an exonic upstream 5’ splice site and the two exons are associated to the same gene

   [Class-3]     
   The class-3 includes circRNAs mapped inside an intron and identified as lariat-derived circRNA or as intron circle.
   Lariat derived circRNAs: the first boundary of the circular junction must coincide with the beginning of the intron and the second boundary must be compatible with a circularization event limited by the branch point 
   Intron circle: the two boundaries of the circular junction coincide with those of the intron

   [Class-4]  
   The class-3 includes circRNAs mapped inside an exon and identified as sub-exonic circRNA

   [Class-5]   
   The class-4 includes circRNAs mapped inside an exon and not identified as sub-exonic circRNA

   



### The annotation rules

    [Class-1]
      for a circRNA located on upstream strand, the start-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 5'splice site 
           OR   
      for a circRNA located on reverse strand, the start-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 3'splice site



    [Class-2]
     for a circRNA located on upstream strand,the end-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 3' splice site
           OR
     for a circRNA located on reverse strand, the end-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 5' splice site



    [Class-2]
The circRNA is mapped inside an intron (same strand)
and
the 5' boundary of the intron must be identified in genomic coordinates of the circRNA: -5/5 nt
and
The 3' boundary of the intron must be identified in genomic coordinates of the circRNA: -60/5 nt

Class-3
The circRNA is mapped inside an exon of a described gene (same strand)
and
the described gene is notdescribed as 'lnc', 'c', or 'pseudo'

Class-4
The circRNA is mapped inside an exon of a described gene (same strand)

and

the described gene is described as 'lnc', 'c', or 'pseudo'

Class-5

for a circRNA located on upstream strand, the start-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 5'splice site associated to a geneA and the end-circRNA is not identified 

or

for a circRNA located on reverse strand, the start-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 3'splice site associated to a geneA and the end-circRNA is not identified

or

for a circRNA located on upstream strand, the start-circRNA is not identified and the end-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 3'splice site associated to a geneB.

or

for a circRNA located on reverse strand, the start-circRNA is not identified and the end-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 5'splice site associated to a geneB.
