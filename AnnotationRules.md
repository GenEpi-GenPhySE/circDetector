### The annotation classes

 
   [Class-1]   The class-1 includes circRNAs with Start-circRNA is identified as known exonic boundary
   
   [Class-2]   The class-2 includes circRNAs with End-circRNA is identified as known exonic boundary
   
   [class-12]     
   Exonic circRNA is generated by the circularization of one or several exons through a back splicing process: the end of an exon is joined to the beginning of an upstream exon. In the circular junction sequenced an exonic downstream donor 3’ splice site is covalently joined to an exonic upstream 5’ splice site and the two exons are associated to the same gene. 

   [Class-3]   The class-3 includes circRNAs mapped inside an intron and identified as lariat-derived circRNA or as intron circle.  
   Lariat derived circRNAs: the first boundary of the circular junction must coincide with the beginning of the intron and the second boundary must be compatible with a circularization event limited by the branch point.  
   Intron circle: the two boundaries of the circular junction coincide with those of the intron

   [Class-4]   The class-4 includes circRNAs mapped inside an exon 
   
   [Class-41]  The class-41 includes circRNAs mapped inside an exon and identified as sub-exonic circRNA because the circRNA has been mapped in a gene from a type reported as pluri-exonic gene

   [Class-42]  The class-42 includes circRNAs mapped inside an exon and not identified as sub-exonic circRNA because the circRNA has been mapped in a gene from a type reported as pluri-exonic gene (protein-coding, lnc or pseudogene)

   



### The annotation rules
    For all classes the strand of the circRNA is identical to the strand of the gene

    [Class-1]
      for a circRNA located on upstream strand, the Start-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 5'splice site 
           OR   
      for a circRNA located on reverse strand, the Start-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 3'splice site


    [Class-2]
     for a circRNA located on upstream strand,the End-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 3' splice site
           OR
     for a circRNA located on reverse strand, the End-circRNA corresponds exactly to an exonic 5' splice site

    [class-12]  
     the circRNA is retained in class-1 and in class-2
     the both associated genes are identical


    [Class-3]
     The circRNA is mapped inside an intron (same strand)
         and
     The 5' boundary of the intron must be compatible with genomic coordinates of the circRNA: -5/5 nt
        and
     The 3' boundary of the intron must be compatible with genomic coordinates of the circRNA: -60/5 nt

    [Class-4]
     The circRNA is mapped inside an exon of a described gene (same strand)
     
    [Class-41]
     The circRNA is retained in Class-4
         and
     The described gene is not described as 'lnc', 'c', or 'pseudo'

    [Class-42]
     The circRNA is retained in Class-4
        and
     The described gene is described as 'lnc', 'c', or 'pseudo'
